# Privacy Policy

This document governs the manner in which the Save to the Wayback Archive Check ("the browser extension") collects, uses or discloses information collected from users of the browser extension. This privacy policy applies to all versions of the browser extension on all platforms.

## Personal Information
The browser extension does not collect, use or disclose personal information with the exception of IP addresses. The IP address of the user is used as part of standard HTTP requests. The browser extension does not keep a record of the user's IP address.

## Web Browsing Information

The browser extension uses some web browsing information to function. The information used is limited to uniform resource locators (URLs) provided by the user. The URLs are used by the browser extension when archiving content to the Wayback Machine. The browser extension does not keep a record of the URLs.

## Browser Permissions

The browser extension needs three browser permissions to function. These permissions are granted when the browser extension is installed by the user.

Name | Description
------ | ------
[Active Tab](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#activeTab_permission) | Access details about the current browser tab (URL, title and status).
[Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage) | Store and retrieve data from disk (user options).
`archive.org` | Send and receive data from the Wayback Machine Availability API.

## Communicating with the Wayback Machine.

The browser extension communicates with the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to facilitate checking the archive status of an URL. The browser extension only communicates with the Wayback Machine when actioned by the user.

The browser extension makes HTTP requests to `https://archive.org/wayback/available`. The URL, IP address and user agent string of the user is sent to the Wayback Machine as part of these HTTP requests. 

By using this browser extension to interact with the Wayback Machine you are agreeing to the Internet Archive's [Terms of Use and Privacy Policy](https://archive.org/about/terms.php).

## Platform Privacy Policies

The browser extension is available on a number of platforms which may collect personal and/or web browsing information.

* [Google's privacy policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/)
